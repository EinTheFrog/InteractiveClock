# Interactive Clock
This tester application is developed for Desktop with QT QML.  

For moving clock hands you should use your mouse and drag them. Minute and hour hands are linked so when you move minute hand hour hands moves accordingly (and vice versa).

Clock hands are moving by themselves emulating real-clocks behaviour. ***Minute hand moves every second and hour hand moves every minute*** for clarity. So, it is easier to check that the clock is working correctly.

Label text in the middle of the clock shows the time in 12 hour format (am/pm). It correclty switches am/pm suffix every 12 hours (12 minutes of real-world time).
